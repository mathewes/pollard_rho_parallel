Function: eval
Section: polynomials
C-Name: geval_gp
Prototype: GC
Help: eval(x): evaluation of x, replacing variables by their value.
Description:
 (gen):gen      geval($1)
Doc: replaces in $x$ the formal variables by the values that
 have been assigned to them after the creation of $x$. This is mainly useful
 in GP, and not in library mode. Do not confuse this with substitution (see
 \kbd{subst}).

 If $x$ is a character string, \kbd{eval($x$)} executes $x$ as a GP
 command, as if directly input from the keyboard, and returns its
 output. For convenience, $x$ is evaluated as if
 \kbd{strictmatch} was off. In particular, unused characters at the end of
 $x$ do not prevent its evaluation:
 \bprog
 ? eval("1a")
   *** eval: Warning: unused characters: a.
 % 1 = 1
 @eprog

 \synt{geval}{GEN x}.
