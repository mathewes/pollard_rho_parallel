Help: polrootspadic(x,p,r): p-adic roots of the polynomial x to precision r.
Doc: row vector of $p$-adic roots of
 the polynomial \var{pol}, given to $p$-adic precision $r$. Multiple roots are
 \emph{not} repeated. $p$ is assumed to be a prime, and \var{pol} to be
 non-zero modulo $p$. Note that this is not the same as the roots in
 $\Z/p^r\Z$, rather it gives approximations in $\Z/p^r\Z$ of the true
 roots living in $\Q_p$.

 If \var{pol} has inexact \typ{PADIC} coefficients, this is not always
 well-defined; in this case, the equation is first made integral, then lifted
 to $\Z$. Hence the roots given are approximations of the roots of a
 polynomial which is $p$-adically close to the input.
