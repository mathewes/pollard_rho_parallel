Function: factorpadic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: factorpadic0
Prototype: GGLD0,L,
Help: factorpadic(pol,p,r,{flag=0}): p-adic factorization of the polynomial pol
 to precision r. flag is optional and may be set to 0 (use round 4) or 1 (use
 Buchmann-Lenstra).
Doc: $p$-adic factorization
 of the polynomial \var{pol} to precision $r$, the result being a
 two-column matrix as in \kbd{factor}. The factors are normalized so that
 their leading coefficient is a power of $p$. $r$ must be strictly larger than
 the $p$-adic valuation of the discriminant of \var{pol} for the result to
 make any sense. The method used is a modified version of the \idx{round 4}
 algorithm of \idx{Zassenhaus}.

 If $\fl=1$, use an algorithm due to \idx{Buchmann} and \idx{Lenstra}, which is
 much less efficient.
Variant:
 \fun{GEN}{factorpadic}{GEN f,GEN p, long r} corresponds to the default
 $\fl=0$.
