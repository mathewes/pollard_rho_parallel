Function: forell
Section: programming/control
C-Name: forell0
Prototype: vVLLI
Help: forell(E,a,b,seq): execute seq for each elliptic curves E of conductor
 between a and b in the elldata database.
Wrapper: (,,,vG)
Description:
 (,small,small,closure):void  forell(${4 cookie}, ${4 wrapper}, $2, $3)
Doc: evaluates \var{seq}, where the formal variable $E$ ranges through all
 elliptic curves of conductors from $a$ to $b$. Th \tet{elldata} database must
 be installed and contain data for the specified conductors.

 \synt{forell}{void *data, long (*call)(void*,GEN), GEN a, GEN b}.
