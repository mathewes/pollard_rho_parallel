C-Name: gtovec
Prototype: DG
Help: Vec({x=[]}): transforms the object x into a vector.
 Empty vector if x is omitted.
Description:
 ():vec           cgetg(1,t_VEC)
 (gen):vec        gtovec($1)
Doc:
 transforms the object $x$ into a row vector.
 That vector has a single component, except when $x$ is

 \item a vector or a quadratic form (in which case the resulting vector
 is simply the initial object considered as a row vector),

 \item a matrix (the vector of columns comprising the matrix is return),

 \item a character string (a vector of individual
 characters is returned),

 \item a polynomial or a power series. In the case of a polynomial, the
 coefficients of the vector start with the leading coefficient of the
 polynomial, while for power series only the significant coefficients are
 taken into account, but this time by increasing order of degree.
 In this last case, \kbd{Vec} is the reciprocal function of \kbd{Pol} and
 \kbd{Ser} respectively.
