C-Name: gtocol
Prototype: DG
Help: Col({x=[]}): transforms the object x into a column vector.
 Empty vector if x is omitted.
Description:
 ():vec        cgetg(1,t_COL)
 (gen):vec     gtocol($1)
Doc:
 transforms the object $x$ into a column vector.
 The vector has a single component , except when $x$ is

 \item a vector or a quadratic form (in which case the resulting vector is
 simply the initial object considered as a column vector),

 \item a matrix (the column of row vectors comprising the matrix is
 returned),

 \item a character string (a column of individual characters is returned),

 \item a polynomial or a power series. In the case of a polynomial, the
 coefficients of the vector start with the leading coefficient of the
 polynomial, while for power series only the significant coefficients are
 taken into account, but this time by increasing order of degree. In this last
 case, \kbd{Col} is the reciprocal function of \kbd{Pol} and \kbd{Ser}
 respectively.

 Note that the function \kbd{Colrev} does not exist, use \kbd{Vecrev}.
