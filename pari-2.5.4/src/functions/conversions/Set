Function: Set
Section: conversions
C-Name: gtoset
Prototype: DG
Help: Set({x=[]}): convert x into a set, i.e. a row vector with strictly
 increasing coefficients. Empty set if x is omitted.
Description:
 ():vec           cgetg(1,t_VEC)
 (gen):vec        gtoset($1)
Doc:
 converts $x$ into a set, i.e.~into a row
 vector of character strings, with strictly increasing entries with respect to
 lexicographic ordering. The components of $x$ are put in canonical form (type
 \typ{STR}) so as to be easily sorted. To recover an ordinary \kbd{GEN} from
 such an element, you can apply \tet{eval} to it.

 Note that most set functions also accept ordinary vectors, provided their
 components can be compared with \kbd{<}. Sets as created by this function
 are only useful when e.g. polynomial or vector entries are involved.
