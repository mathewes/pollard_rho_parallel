Function: Vecsmall
Section: conversions
C-Name: gtovecsmall
Prototype: DG
Help: Vecsmall({x=[]}): transforms the object x into a VECSMALL. Empty
 vector if x is omitted.
Description:
 (gen):vecsmall                gtovecsmall($1)
Doc:
 transforms the object $x$ into a row
 vector of type \typ{VECSMALL}. This acts as \kbd{Vec}, but only on a
 limited set of objects (the result must be representable as a vector of small
 integers). In particular, polynomials and power series are forbidden.
 If $x$ is a character string, a vector of individual characters in ASCII
 encoding is returned (\tet{Strchr} yields back the character string).
