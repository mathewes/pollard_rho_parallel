Function: ellsearch
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellsearch
Prototype: G
Help: ellsearch(N): if N is an integer, it is taken as a conductor else if N is
 a string, it can be a curve name ("11a1"), a isogeny class ("11a") or a
 conductor ("11"). Return all curves in the elldata database that match the
 property.
Doc: if $N$ is an integer, it is taken as a conductor else if $N$ is a
 string, it can be a curve name ("11a1"), an isogeny class ("11a") or a
 conductor "11". This function finds all curves in the \tet{elldata} database
 with the given property.

 If $N$ is a full curve name, the output format is $[N, [a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6],
 G]$ where $[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6]$ are the coefficients of the Weierstrass
 equation of the curve and $G$ is a $\Z$-basis of the free part of the
 \idx{Mordell-Weil group} associated to the curve.

 If $N$ is not a full-curve name, the output is a vector of all matching
 curves in the above format.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{ellsearchcurve}{GEN N} that only
 accepts complete curve names.
