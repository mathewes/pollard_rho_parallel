Help: ellak(E,n): computes the n-th Fourier coefficient of the L-function of
 the elliptic curve E (assumed E is a minimal model).
Doc:
 computes the coefficient $a_n$ of the
 $L$-function of the elliptic curve $E$, i.e.~in principle coefficients of a
 newform of weight 2 assuming \idx{Taniyama-Weil conjecture} (which is now
 known to hold in full generality thanks to the work of \idx{Breuil},
 \idx{Conrad}, \idx{Diamond}, \idx{Taylor} and \idx{Wiles}). $E$ must be a
 \var{smallell} as output by \kbd{ellinit}. For this function
 to work for every $n$ and not just those prime to the conductor, $E$ must
 be a minimal Weierstrass equation. If this is not the case, use the
 function \kbd{ellminimalmodel} before using \kbd{ellak}.
