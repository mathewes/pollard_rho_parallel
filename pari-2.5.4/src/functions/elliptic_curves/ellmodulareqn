Function: ellmodulareqn
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellmodulareqn
Prototype: LDnDn
Help: ellmodulareqn(l,{x},{y}): return a vector [eqn, t] where eqn is a modular
 equation of level l, for l<500, l prime. This requires the package seadata to
 be installed.  The equation is either of canonical type (t=0) or of Atkin type
 (t=1)
Doc: return a vector [\kbd{eqn},$t$] where \kbd{eqn} is a modular equation of
 level $l$, for $l<500$, $l$ prime. This requires the package seadata to be
 installed. The equation is either of canonical type ($t=0$) or of Atkin type
 ($t=1$).
