Function: ellgenerators
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellgenerators
Prototype: G
Help: ellgenerators(E): if E is an elliptic curve as output by ellinit(),
 return the generators of the Mordell-Weil group associated to the curve.
 This function depends on the curve being referenced in the elldata database.
Doc:
 returns a $\Z$-basis of the free part of the
 \idx{Mordell-Weil group} associated to $E$.  This function depends on the
 \tet{elldata} database being installed and referencing the curve, and so
 is only available for curves over $\Z$ of small conductors.
