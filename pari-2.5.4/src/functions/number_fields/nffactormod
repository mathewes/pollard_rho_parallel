Help: nffactormod(nf,pol,pr): factorize polynomial pol modulo prime ideal pr
 in number field nf.
Doc: factorization of the
 univariate polynomial $x$ modulo the prime ideal \var{pr} in the number
 field $\var{nf}$. $x$ can have coefficients in the number field (scalar,
 polmod, polynomial, column vector) or modulo the prime ideal (intmod
 modulo the rational prime under \var{pr}, polmod or polynomial with
 intmod coefficients, column vector of intmod). The prime ideal
 \var{pr} \emph{must} be in the format output by \kbd{idealprimedec}. The
 main variable of $\var{nf}$ must be of lower priority than that of $x$
 (see \secref{se:priority}). However if the coefficients of the number
 field occur explicitly (as polmods) as coefficients of $x$, the variable of
 these polmods \emph{must} be the same as the main variable of $t$ (see
 \kbd{nffactor}).
