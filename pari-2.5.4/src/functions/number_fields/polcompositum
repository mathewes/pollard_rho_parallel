C-Name: polcompositum0
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: polcompositum(P,Q,{flag=0}): vector of all possible compositums
 of the number fields defined by the polynomials P and Q. If (optional)
 flag is set (i.e non-null), output for each compositum, not only the
 compositum polynomial pol, but a vector [R,a,b,k] where a (resp. b) is a root
 of P (resp. Q) expressed as a polynomial modulo R,
 and a small integer k such that al2+k*al1 is the chosen root of R.
Doc: \sidx{compositum} $P$ and $Q$
 being squarefree polynomials in $\Z[X]$ in the same variable, outputs
 the simple factors of the \'etale $\Q$-algebra $A = \Q(X, Y) / (P(X), Q(Y))$.
 The factors are given by a list of polynomials $R$ in $\Z[X]$, associated to
 the number field $\Q(X)/ (R)$, and sorted by increasing degree (with respect
 to lexicographic ordering for factors of equal degrees). Returns an error if
 one of the polynomials is not squarefree.

 Note that it is more efficient to reduce to the case where $P$ and $Q$ are
 irreducible first. The routine will not perform this for you, since it may be
 expensive, and the inputs are irreducible in most applications anyway.
 Assuming $P$ is irreducible (of smaller degree than $Q$ for efficiency), it
 is in general \emph{much} faster to proceed as follows
 \bprog
 nf = nfinit(P); L = nffactor(nf, Q)[,1];
 vector(#L, i, rnfequation(nf, L[i]))
 @eprog\noindent
 to obtain the same result. If you are only interested in the degrees of the
 simple factors, the \kbd{rnfequation} instruction can be replaced by a
 trivial \kbd{poldegree(P) * poldegree(L[i])}.

 If $\fl=1$, outputs a vector of 4-component vectors $[R,a,b,k]$, where $R$
 ranges through the list of all possible compositums as above, and $a$
 (resp. $b$) expresses the root of $P$ (resp. $Q$) as an element of
 $\Q(X)/(R)$. Finally, $k$ is a small integer such that $b + ka = X$ modulo
 $R$.

 A compositum is quite often defined by a complicated polynomial, which it is
 advisable to reduce before further work. Here is a simple example involving
 the field $\Q(\zeta_5, 5^{1/5})$:
 \bprog
 ? z = polcompositum(x^5 - 5, polcyclo(5), 1)[1];
 ? pol = z[1]                 \\@com \kbd{pol} defines the compositum
 %2 = x^20 + 5*x^19 + 15*x^18 + 35*x^17 + 70*x^16 + 141*x^15 + 260*x^14 \
 + 355*x^13 + 95*x^12 - 1460*x^11 - 3279*x^10 - 3660*x^9 - 2005*x^8    \
 + 705*x^7 + 9210*x^6 + 13506*x^5 + 7145*x^4 - 2740*x^3 + 1040*x^2     \
 - 320*x + 256
 ? a = z[2]; a^5 - 5          \\@com \kbd{a} is a fifth root of $5$
 %3 = 0
 ? z = polredabs(pol, 1);     \\@com look for a simpler polynomial
 ? pol = z[1]
 %5 = x^20 + 25*x^10 + 5
 ? a = subst(a.pol, x, z[2])  \\@com \kbd{a} in the new coordinates
 %6 = Mod(-5/22*x^19 + 1/22*x^14 - 123/22*x^9 + 9/11*x^4, x^20 + 25*x^10 + 5)
