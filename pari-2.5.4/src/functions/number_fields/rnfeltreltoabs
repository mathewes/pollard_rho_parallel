Help: rnfeltreltoabs(rnf,x): transforms the element x from relative to
 absolute representation.
Doc: $\var{rnf}$ being a relative
 number field extension $L/K$ as output by \kbd{rnfinit} and $x$ being an
 element of $L$ expressed as a polynomial or polmod with polmod
 coefficients, computes $x$ as an element of the absolute extension $L/\Q$ as
 a polynomial modulo the absolute equation \kbd{\var{rnf}.pol}. If $x$ is
 given on the relative integral basis, apply \kbd{rnfbasistoalg} first,
 otherwise PARI will believe you are dealing with a vector.
