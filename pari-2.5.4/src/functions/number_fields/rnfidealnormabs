Help: rnfidealnormabs(rnf,x): absolute norm of the ideal x.
Doc: $\var{rnf}$ being a relative
 number field extension $L/K$ as output by \kbd{rnfinit} and $x$ being a
 relative ideal (which can be, as in the absolute case, of many different
 types, including of course elements), computes the norm of the ideal $x$
 considered as an ideal of the absolute extension $L/\Q$. This is identical to
 \kbd{idealnorm(rnfidealnormrel(\var{rnf},x))}, but faster.
