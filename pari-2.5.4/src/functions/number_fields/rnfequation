Function: rnfequation
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfequation0
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: rnfequation(nf,pol,{flag=0}): given a pol with coefficients in nf,
 gives the absolute equation apol of the number field defined by pol. flag is
 optional, and can be 0: default, or non-zero, gives [apol,th], where th
 expresses the root of nf.pol in terms of the root of apol.
Doc: given a number field
 $\var{nf}$ as output by \kbd{nfinit} (or simply a polynomial) and a
 polynomial \var{pol} with coefficients in $\var{nf}$ defining a relative
 extension $L$ of $\var{nf}$, computes the absolute equation of $L$ over
 $\Q$.

 If $\fl$ is non-zero, outputs a 3-component row vector $[z,a,k]$, where
 $z$ is the absolute equation of $L$ over $\Q$, as in the default behavior,
 $a$ expresses as an element of $L$ a root $\alpha$ of the polynomial
 defining the base field $\var{nf}$, and $k$ is a small integer such that
 $\theta = \beta+k\alpha$ where $\theta$ is a root of $z$ and $\beta$ a root
 of $\var{pol}$.

 The main variable of $\var{nf}$ \emph{must} be of lower priority than that
 of \var{pol} (see \secref{se:priority}). Note that for efficiency, this does
 not check whether the relative equation is irreducible over $\var{nf}$, but
 only if it is squarefree. If it is reducible but squarefree, the result will
 be the absolute equation of the \'etale algebra defined by \var{pol}. If
 \var{pol} is not squarefree, an error message will be issued.
Variant: Also available are
 \fun{GEN}{rnfequation}{GEN nf, GEN pol} ($\fl = 0$) and
 \fun{GEN}{rnfequation2}{GEN nf, GEN pol} ($\fl = 1$).
