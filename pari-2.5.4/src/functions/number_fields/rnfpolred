Function: rnfpolred
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfpolred
Prototype: GGp
Help: rnfpolred(nf,pol): given a pol with coefficients in nf, finds a list
 of relative polynomials defining some subfields, hopefully simpler.
Doc: relative version of \kbd{polred}.
 Given a monic polynomial \var{pol} with coefficients in $\var{nf}$, finds a
 list of relative polynomials defining some subfields, hopefully simpler and
 containing the original field. In the present version \vers, this is slower
 and less efficient than \kbd{rnfpolredabs}.
