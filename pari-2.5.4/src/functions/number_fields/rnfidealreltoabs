C-Name: rnfidealreltoabs
Prototype: GG
Help: rnfidealreltoabs(rnf,x): transforms the ideal x from relative to
 absolute representation.
Doc: $\var{rnf}$ being a relative
 number field extension $L/K$ as output by \kbd{rnfinit} and $x$ being a
 relative ideal, gives the ideal $x\Z_L$ as an absolute ideal of $L/\Q$, in
 the form of a $\Z$-basis, given by a vector of polynomials (modulo
 \kbd{rnf.pol}).
 The following routine might be useful:
 \bprog
 \\ return y = rnfidealreltoabs(rnf,...) as an ideal in HNF form
 \\ associated to nf = nfinit( rnf.pol );
 idealgentoHNF(nf, y) = mathnf( Mat( nfalgtobasis(nf, y) ) );
