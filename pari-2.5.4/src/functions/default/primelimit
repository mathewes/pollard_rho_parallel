Doc: \kbd{gp} precomputes a list of
 all primes less than \kbd{primelimit} at initialization time. These are used
 by many arithmetic functions, usually for trial division purposes. If you do
 not plan to invoke any of them, you can just set this to 1. The maximal value
 is a little less than $2^{32}$ (resp $2^{64}$) on a 32-bit (resp.~64-bit)
 machine.

 Since almost all arithmetic functions eventually require some table of prime
 numbers, PARI currently guarantees that the first 6547 primes, up to and
 including 65557, are precomputed, even if \kbd{primelimit} is $1$.

 The default value is \kbd{500k}.
