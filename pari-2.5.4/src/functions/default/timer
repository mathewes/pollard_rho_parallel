Help:
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). If on, every instruction
 sequence (anything ended by a
 newline in your input) is timed, to some accuracy depending on the hardware
 and operating system. The time measured is the user \idx{CPU time},
 \emph{not} including the time for printing the results (see \kbd{\#} and
 \kbd{\#\#}).

 The default value is \kbd{0}.
