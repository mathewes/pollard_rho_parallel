Function: bezoutres
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: vecbezoutres
Prototype: GG
Help: bezoutres(x,y): gives a 3-dimensional row vector [u,v,d] such that
 d=resultant(x,y) and u*x+v*y=d, where x and y are polynomials.
Doc: finds $u$ and $v$ such that $x*u + y*v = d$, where $d$ is the resultant
 of $x$ and $y$. The result is the row vector $[u,v,d]$. \sidx{extended gcd}
 The algorithm used (subresultant) assumes that the base ring is a domain.
