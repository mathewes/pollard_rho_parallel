Function: bigomega
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: gbigomega
Prototype: G
Help: bigomega(x): number of prime divisors of x, counted with multiplicity.
Description:
 (int):small      bigomega($1)
 (gen):gen        gbigomega($1)
Doc: number of prime divisors of the integer $|x|$ counted with
 multiplicity:
 \bprog
 ? factor(392)
 %1 =
 [2 3]

 [7 2]

 ? bigomega(392)
 %2 = 5;  \\ = 3+2
 ? omega(392)
 %3 = 2;  \\ without multiplicity
 @eprog
 The function accepts vector/matrices arguments, and is then applied
 componentwise.
Variant: For a \typ{INT} $x$, the variant
 \fun{long}{bigomega}{GEN n} is generally easier to use.
