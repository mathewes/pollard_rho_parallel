Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: jacobi
Prototype: Gp
Help: qfjacobi(x): eigenvalues and orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors of the
 real symmetric matrix x.
Doc: $x$ being a real symmetric matrix, this gives a
 vector having two components: the first one is the vector of (real)
 eigenvalues of $x$, sorted in increasing order, the second is the
 corresponding orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors of $x$. The method used is
 Jacobi's method for symmetric matrices.
